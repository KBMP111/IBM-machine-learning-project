    "BY clustering similar cities it can be possible to enhance travel and tourism recommendations. This will allow tourists to better plan their trips and have a 'feeling' of what to expect when visitng Africa. Secondly, Africa is an emerging region with abundant natural resouorces and a young population this presents an opportunity for investors looking for higher returns and a strong market positons or monopolies. With the clustering possible in this project tourists, investors and etc, can better understand African Cities what they have to offer and the opportunites arising there.\n"
